          I grew up in Fredrikstad, a small city on the southeast shoreside of
          Norway. Whilst growing up I never really saw myself going anywhere.
          Couldn't even see past tomorrows school bell ringing.. When turning 16
          I started working in the city's only proper coffee shop at the time,
          and by the time I was 18 I was there fulltime. I worked hard,
          participated in several coffee courses, and was taught by Norwegian-
          and World Barista and coffee brewing champions.
          <br />
          <br />
          But I never began competing professionally myself.. <i>Why?</i>
          <br />
          <br />
          During my journey, there is a line that keep repeating itself,
          <b>learning by doing</b>. And this extends to getting to know myself.
          So over the years I started to get to know the me, and what I actually
          wanted in my life, through life and of life.
          <br />
          This eventually brought me to programming. Creative and hands on
          projects that would put me in a creative position, be a part of
          product, and actually be able to use my already well trained business
          and customer service skills.
