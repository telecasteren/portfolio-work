            <p id="paragraph1"> I grew up in Fredrikstad, a small city on the east shoreside of Norway.
                Whilst growing up I never really saw myself going anywhere.
                Couldn't even see past tomorrows school bell ringing..
                When turning 16 I started working in the city's only proper coffee shop at the time,
                and by the time I was 18 I was there fulltime.
                I worked hard, participated in several coffee courses,
                and was taught by the great Norwegian and World champion Tim Wendelboe.
