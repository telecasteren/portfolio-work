        <b>Countdown clock project</b> This started out as a christmas and
        birthday gift for my fianc√©. A substitute for the classic cardpaper that
        eventually ends up as trash, this could be a means to gather memories
        and make them live indefinately. I never quite finished the project, but
        I believe it has potential.
