      "Born in 1991, I feel lucky to have lived through our world‚Äôs transition from analog to digital as we know it today. Growing up in a small town on the southeast side of Norway, I never really saw myself going anywhere, living in between the sound of the school bell chiming. I was all about that punk rock environment, grungy basement jams with our ‚Äúcrew‚Äù, spending all our allowance money going to concerts.\nWhen I turned 16, I started working in ‚Äúthe‚Äù city coffee shop, and by the time I was 18, I was there full-time. Had to find a way to pay for all the concerts and LP‚Äôs I consumed. But, I worked hard, took some coffee courses, and I was actually very lucky to be taught by that era‚Äôs Norwegian World Barista. I never began competing professionally myself though. Why? Despite my outgoing work environment and social life, I have always been quite introverted when it comes to such. Gaining a deeper understanding of what that meant throughout the years, I think I finally found my true aspirations in life. And it wasn‚Äôt competing.\nI can admit that I am a fineschmecker when it comes to food and drinks. I do appreciate the subtleties and intricacies of good quality produce. It originates from my days as a Barista in the Specialty Coffee Industry I guess. Well, I think it‚Äôs safe to say my fellow ex-colleagues are ‚Äúvictims‚Äù of the same sins. üòâ",

      "I love traveling and engaging in outdoor activities. And I work out. I can let you in on a little secret that I recently rediscovered skating, and when in Bali, I seemed to enjoy surfing as well. Honestly, I am not skilled at either. Not even a little.. But what matters most is the fun I have along the way, right?!",
