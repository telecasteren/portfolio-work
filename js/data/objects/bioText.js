    paragraph1:
      "I grew up in Fredrikstad, a small city on the southeast shoreside of Norway. Whilst growing up, I never really saw myself going anywhere, not even seeing past tomorrow’s school bell ringing. When I turned 16, I started working in the city's only proper coffee shop at the time, and by the time I was 18, I was there full-time. I worked hard, participated in several coffee courses, and was taught by the Norwegian, World Barista and coffee brewing champions at that time. But I never began competing professionally myself. Why? Because throughout my journey, the principle of <b>learning by doing</b> consistently resonated with me. This approach extended to self-discovery, and over the years, I gained a deeper understanding of myself and my true aspirations in life. And it wasn't competing.\nWhen it comes to food and drinks, I must admit that I am a fineschmecker, appreciating the subtleties and intricacies of good quality from my days as a Barista. Away from the screen, I work out and love engaging in activities. I recently rediscovered skating and during my travels abroad I seem to enjoy surfing as well. Even if I'm not particularly skilled at either. What matters most to me is the fun I have along the way.",
    paragraph2:
      "This journey and my self-discovery eventually brought me to programming—hands-on projects that put me in a creative position, allowing me to be part of product development. This shift enabled me to use my well-trained business and customer service skills in a very different manner.\nI possess a high visualizing ability and an good sense of direction, which complements my generic musical talent. While I'm not a virtuoso on the guitar, I enjoy playing multiple instruments. Though fairly introverted, I am an outgoing and social soul who thrives in teacher-student interactions, constantly seeking to learn and share knowledge. My kinetic energy and quick learning capacity drive my engagement in every pursuit. Additionally, I have a good memory and strong editing skills, which come in handy in my professional life.\nBeing inspired by nature, I find joy in spending time outdoors and around animals. Although I am not your role model for maintaining it, I advocate for a balanced and healthy lifestyle, both in work and play. Self-awareness and reflective thinking guide me towards continuous self-improvement. I approach tasks with an intuitive, independent mindset, and excel when working autonomously. My philosophic and rational nature helps me maintain logical and organized strategies in my professional endeavors.\nHowever, I recognize that my philosophical and rational thinking can sometimes lead to jumping on ideas without thorough planning. While I am proficient in various domains, I have not been seeking mastery in a specific field. I am too curious to settle for one thing. Small talk isn't my strong suit, and I tend to work excessively, finding it hard to let go of tasks that need attention. I often feel compelled to point out areas for improvement and have instructive tendencies, which can be both a strength and a challenge.\nIn navigating my own journey of self-awareness, I recognize that I possess a strong mind and voice that can occupy significant space. However, I am keenly aware of the feeling of being sidelined or overlooked. Therefore, I actively strive to ensure that every member of the team and organization is heard and valued. I believe in creating an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are not only acknowledged but actively sought out and respected, fostering a culture where everyone can thrive and contribute meaningfully.",
