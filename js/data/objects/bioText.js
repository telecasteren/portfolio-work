    paragraph1:
      "Born in 1991, I feel lucky to have lived through our worlds transition from analog to digital as we know it today. Growing up in a small town on the east shoreside of Norway, I never really saw myself going anywhere, living in between the sound of the school bell chiming.\nWhen I turned 16, I started working in a city coffee shop, and by the time I was 18, I was there full-time. I worked hard, took coffee courses, and was lucky to be taught by the Norwegian World Barista at that time. I never began competing professionally myself. Why? Despite my outgoing work-environment and social life, I have always been quite introvert. Gaining a deeper understanding of myself throughout the years, I found my true aspirations in life. And it wasn't competing.\nWhen it comes to food and drinks, I can admit that I am a fineschmecker, appreciating the subtleties and intricacies of good quality from my days as a Barista. Away from the screen, I love engaging in activities and work out. I recently rediscovered skating and during travelling abroad I seem to enjoy surfing as well. I am not particularly skilled at either. But what matters most to me is the fun I have along the way.",

      "This journey and my self-discovery eventually brought me to programmingâ€”hands-on projects that put me in a creative position, allowing me to be part of product development. This shift enabled me to use my well-trained business and customer service skills in a very different manner.\nI possess a high visualizing ability and an good sense of direction, which complements my generic musical talent. While I'm not a virtuoso on the guitar, I enjoy playing multiple instruments. Though fairly introverted, I am an outgoing and social soul who thrives in teacher-student interactions, constantly seeking to learn and share knowledge. My kinetic energy and quick learning capacity drive my engagement in every pursuit. Additionally, I have a good memory and strong editing skills, which come in handy in my professional life.\nBeing inspired by nature, I find joy in spending time outdoors and around animals. Although I am not your role model for maintaining it, I advocate for a balanced and healthy lifestyle, both in work and play. Self-awareness and reflective thinking guide me towards continuous self-improvement. I approach tasks with an intuitive, independent mindset, and excel when working autonomously. My philosophic and rational nature helps me maintain logical and organized strategies in my professional endeavors.\nHowever, I recognize that my philosophical and rational thinking can sometimes lead to jumping on ideas without thorough planning. While I am proficient in various domains, I have not been seeking mastery in a specific field. I am too curious to settle for one thing. Small talk isn't my strong suit, and I tend to work excessively, finding it hard to let go of tasks that need attention. I often feel compelled to point out areas for improvement and have instructive tendencies, which can be both a strength and a challenge.\nIn navigating my own journey of self-awareness, I recognize that I possess a strong mind and voice that can occupy significant space. However, I am keenly aware of the feeling of being sidelined or overlooked. Therefore, I actively strive to ensure that every member of the team and organization is heard and valued. I believe in creating an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are not only acknowledged but actively sought out and respected, fostering a culture where everyone can thrive and contribute meaningfully.",
